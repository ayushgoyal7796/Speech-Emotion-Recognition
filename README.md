# Speech-Emotion-Recognition
The objective of this Deep Learning model is to recognize the emotions from speech.

-Implementation has been done in Keras.
-I have used CNN and CNN-LSTM models for classification task.
-I have used data augmentation to increase size of the training set in order to get better classification accuracy.
-Results have been computed on three benchmark datasets namely Emo-db, RAVDESS and SAVEE.
-Results on all the datasets are pretty good.
